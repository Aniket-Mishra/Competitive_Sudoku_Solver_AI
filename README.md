# 2AMU10_Foundations_of_Artificial_Intelligence
Repository for the code to create an AI agent to play competitive Sudoku.

Main only contains the final code. Everything is in the branches. The branch names are weird, but rest assured, I tried.

Multiple methodologies were explored:
1. Heuristics: Taboo moves, illegal moves, block opponent, explore, etc.
2. Minimax Algorithm - Alpha Beta, Depth search, etc.
3. Monte Carlo Tree Search
4. Markov Chains
5. Transformers - Timed out on Uni's server - Constrains too tight.

Gameplay Analytics:
Scripts to simulate games and record statistics like win/lose, number of moves to end game/trap opponent/get trapped by opponent, and multiple other methods to perform comparision between different algorithms.
